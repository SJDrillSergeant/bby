                            <p>Whilst reading the project description on Canvas, my subconsciousness was leaning towards designing an object related to warfare and violence. The practicality of designing and printing a handgun is, in my opinion, to a great extent. The design process would be more interesting and I could potentially use my creation as protection for myself and my family, gimmicking a real gun if I would somehow encounter a burglar or a drug addict threatening me, consequently scaring him away. My experience with Fusion 360 enabled me to just launch the software and begin sketching. </p></font>
                            
                            <font color="ffffff"><h2>MODELLING</h2>
                            
                            <p>I began drawing a couple of lines on the XY plane, roughly estimating the dimensions for the front sight, slide and the barrell itself.  </p></font>

                            <p><font color="ffffff">I then created another sketch on the XZ-plane, using the first sketch as reference, enabling me to decide the appropriate diameter for the muzzle as well as the barrell, the width of it and height. With a little bit of trimming, filleting and mirroring the sketches looked like this. </font></p>    
            
                            <img src="Fview.jpg" width="890" height="650">
                            <img src="Hview.jpg" width="890" height="600">
                            
                            <p><font color="ffffff">I selected the appropriate profiles and extruded them in two directions. I decided to give the gun a little makeover regarding detail and sketched on the XY-face of the body and also extruded it, symmetrically. I used my second sketch and extruded it throughout the whole front part of the body, cutting out the majority of it. I created a cylinder, just short of the original diameter of the barrell and used the second sketch again extrusion and created a new body, the muzzle itself. The fruits of my labour can be seen on the images below. </font></p>

                            <p><font color="ffffff">I do admit, I modelled the rest of the gun in quite a hurry. I started off by creating an offset plane from a bottom face of the gun body, brought it down to a desirable height for the handle, created a sketch on that blane, extruded it through the gun body itself, rotated it and did some tweaks to create somewhat of a „grip“ and front strap. I then joined the two bodies. I created another sketch on the XZ plane, extruded it throught the upper-end part of the newly joint body, cutting out a cylinder space for the upcoming cross-sight scope. Lastly, I cut out a part of the handle, making room for the squeezing of the trigger. Images below. </font></p>

                            <p><font color="ffffff">The final thing to complete was the scope as well as the trigger. I created two more sketches, same old. Extruded -> tweaked -> Combined. Now I had completed my model. </font></p>

I started off by downloading the software <a href="https://www.qlone.pro">Qlone</a> onto my iPhone. When you've downloaded the app, you then visit their website and download the image displayed below.
