                            <p><font color="ffffff">To be fully honest, the preparation stage for this specific project wasn´t extensive. I´d never coded HTML but some of my closest friends are quite proficient, and therefore I had an idea of how the process would end up looking like. I wanted to make sure my work ethic for this project wouldn´t turn out negative based on the fact that considered myself somewhat informed, so I decided to give this guy Mike Dane a chance, and watched his HTML5 course on YouTube. Interesting guy.</font></p>

                            <p><font color="ffffff">I convinced myself that I would follow, in detail, the project description by reading it for the 2nd time and began working on my masterpiece of a webpage. I´ve always been keen on nice interfaces, so by the time I was deciding whether I should choose one of the given  templates provided by @ajlkn or start coding from scratch, I was positive that either way, I´d emphasize on making a nice looking site. Soon later I stumbled upon a project done by a previous student of this course, Birgir Steinn Hermannsson. Haflidi Asgeirsson, the supervisory teacher of the course, had posted two exemplary projects previously done, one of them being Birgir´s. I took a look at his contribution for this specific project and decided to use it as an inspiration. Not only did I find his work  practical, but my requirements of how I wanted my website to look like fit perfectly with the interface he ended up with making. Credit to him.</font></p>
                            
                            
                            <p><font color="ffffff">The core of my HTML script and .css file are very similar to the ones Birgir uploaded to GitHub. I began this process by writing similar codes using <a href="http://brackets.io/">brackets</a> with the intention of understanding every aspect of them in order to be able to create a website that would furthermore fit into my field of ongoing build of requirements. I am, to some extent, satisfied with this website.   </font></p>

                            <h2>How I uploaded my website</h2>
                            <p>I uploaded the website through the GitHub desktop app.
                            <p>These are the steps I followed in order to do so:</p>
                            <p>1. Create repository on the Github on the website (make sure that it is public).</p>
                            <p>2. Clone the repository on Github Desktop.</p>
                            <p>3. Transfer Brackets files into the repository on your desktop that mirrors the one you created on the website.</p>
                            <p>4. Commit to master.</p>
                            <p>5. Push Origin.</p>
                            <p>6. On the Github website go to your repository.</p>
                            <p>7. Go to settings. Scroll down till you see Github Pages. Select Brancch as master and file as /(root).</p>
                            <p>8. Press save.</p>
                            <p>9. You should now have a link to your working website.</p>
